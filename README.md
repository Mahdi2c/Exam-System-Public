# Exam-System-Public


This exam system was designed and created with a group, with each member completing a certain class, my job was to work on one of the 3 main classes - the trainee. 
This system was awarded and picked as one of the top 5 best projects by the uni.

The system consists of 3 main users : 
  -the administrator creates trainees and trainers
  -the trainer which creates tests and marks tests
  -the trainee which actually the takes the tests
  
In the system the trainee is able to take a test and enrol on certain modules, once the tests are complete they are then able to review the feedback 
for the exam they completed.

This projects main goal was to create a complicated system with many functions using javascript - css and styling was not the main focus.

After completing the test the menu changes from "Take test" to "Review Grade" so that the trainee may review their temporary grade - the closed ended questions 
(the 2+2 questions) is automatically marked, however the open-ended questions is left unmarked so that the trainer may mark it:
